# Mini_Ex9_Flowchart
For this week, I have produced a flowchart based on mini_ex7, since this is the one I found to be most challenging and engaging. Here is a link for the folder: https://github.com/MathiasTvilling/Mini_ex7_Japanese_Haiku_Generator

The flowchart for the program looks like this:

The flowchart is aimed at a person who has the same ammount of limited experience in programming as I have. However, I did not want to over complicate it, and went for a boiled down version of what happens, but in a technical language. The elements I have chosen to include are there because I belive these are what constitutes the program. I could have included decision gates conserned which the making of the arrays and variables, but I chose not to in order to keep a simple overview of what the program does, and how. 

One thing I got to think about in doing this flowchart, is how I find simplicity in code and programming to be very difficult to obtain. In making the program, we overcame plenty of hurdles, and it proved a challenging task. But all of that, can be boiled down to something as simple as the flowchart above. I can imagine flowcharts is an effective way of keeping track of ideas, and perhaps materializing concepts for programming without having to code them. 

_GROUP WORK_
The first idea we came up with is based on the use of API's. It is a Twitterbot, made to look like a completely regular man. This profile then tweets nothing but tweets from the hashtag #meetoo. It pulls these tweets from female profiles, but posts them as though it was a man sharing his experiences instead. This idea is meant to explore if there is a difference in perception of the tweets when coming from the opposite gender. The flowchart looks like this:

The second idea was to create something like an inverted Facebook. We were very interested in the metrics of Facebook, and how we are allowed to see some of the metrics, but not all. So the idea was to create a layout in which the hidden metrics are the ones shown to us. "500 people scrolled past this photo without liking" for example. The flowchart looks like this:
