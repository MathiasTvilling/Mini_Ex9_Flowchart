# Mini_Ex9_Flowchart
For this week, I have produced a flowchart based on mini_ex7, since this is the one I found to be most challenging and engaging. Here is a link for the folder: https://github.com/MathiasTvilling/Mini_ex7_Japanese_Haiku_Generator

The flowchart for the program looks like this:

The flowchart is aimed at a person who has the same ammount of limited experience in programming as I have. However, I did not want to over complicate it, and went for a boiled down version of what happens, but in a technical language. The elements I have chosen to include are there because I belive these are what constitutes the program. I could have included decision gates conserned which the making of the arrays and variables, but I chose not to in order to keep a simple overview of what the program does, and how. 

One thing I got to think about in doing this flowchart, is how I find simplicity in code and programming to be very difficult to obtain. In making the program, we overcame plenty of hurdles, and it proved a challenging task. But all of that, can be boiled down to something as simple as the flowchart above. I can imagine flowcharts is an effective way of keeping track of ideas, and perhaps materializing concepts for programming without having to code them.
